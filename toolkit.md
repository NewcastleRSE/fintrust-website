We all need to be able to trust the financial services we use. 

But in the age of new digital banking technologies and "FinTech", understanding how we should build trustworthy financial services is a topic of public concern. This toolkit explores such problems inherent in engineering trust into financial services, and discusses potential tools and solutions arising through new research undertaken at Newcastle University in the FinTrust project.

Digital banking can pose challenges for citizens, raising vulnerability concerns around trust in banking institutions: branch closures, accessibility of online services, and digital skills and understanding all play a role in the inclusion and participation of people in the digital society. 

FinTrust investigates digitization and its impact on society. Our Trust Engineering Tool Kit translates the understanding and techniques developed through the FinTrust project into reusable methods and software tools. The articles within these pages are aimed at FinTech stakeholders, to help your business to better understand trust and trustworthy systems within the context of increasing automation of financial services.

<!--
As part of the FinTrust project, we have carried out software development projects
to better understand the viability of ideas bourne out of our qualitative research. 
Below are curated a number of these projects, including links to code and descriptions 
of the work. FinTrust retains a full-time research software engineer from the 
Newcastle University [RSE Team](https://rse.ncldata.dev/) 
to undertake these projects and provide software engineering rigor and expertise.
