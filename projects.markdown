title: FinTrust Trust Engineering Toolkit
category: Projects
---

The FinTrust Trust Engineering Tool Kit translates the understanding and techniques developed
through the FinTrust project into reusable methods and software tools. Our aim is to produce
a set of tools and articles which will allow FinTech stakeholders to better appreciate trust and trustworthy systems in the context of ongoing increasing automation of financial services through machine learning.

<!--
As part of the FinTrust project, we have carried out software development projects
to better understand the viability of ideas bourne out of our qualitative research. 
Below are curated a number of these projects, including links to code and descriptions 
of the work. FinTrust retains a full-time research software engineer from the 
Newcastle University [RSE Team](https://rse.ncldata.dev/) 
to undertake these projects and provide software engineering rigor and expertise.
