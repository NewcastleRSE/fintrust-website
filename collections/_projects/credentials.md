Can blockchain technologies support vulnerable and financially excluded customers? In 
this project, we implemented a prototype decentralised identity system using the Microsoft
ION platform, to allow customers to retain ownership of their personal details and to share
them securely.

This project was part of the Trustworthy Digital Infrastructure for Identity Systems project, led by the Turing Institute
and funded through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ([INV-001309](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2019/12/INV001309)).

on our verifiable credentials Finclusion project.

## Code
The project is split into two code repositories: the issuer and the verifier. These can be
accessed at:

  - [https://github.com/NewcastleRSE/fintrust-vc-issuer](https://github.com/NewcastleRSE/fintrust-vc-issuer)
  - [https://github.com/NewcastleRSE/fintrust-vc-verifier](https://github.com/NewcastleRSE/fintrust-vc-verifier)

These repositories are currently private but can be accessed on request. We will be releasing these publicly
in due course. For the time being, please request access using our [contact form](/contact.html), or by emailing
