How can we engineer trust into conversational interfaces? Within this project, we prototyped
a conversational interface using the [Google DialogFlow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/)
conversational analysis AI. Through this prototype, we explored peoples' attitudes to
managing their financial assets using a chatbot.

A chatbot is an artificial intelligence application that can imitate a real conversation
with a human in their natural language. Chatbots enable communication via text or audio
on websites, messaging applications, mobile apps, or telephone.
