Samantha joined the team in August 2021, following a postdoctoral research position in which she developed tools for modelling crop distribution across the UK. She is a trained researcher and full-stack web developer, with experience in a range of technologies and a background in Human-Computer Interaction.

Her PhD work focused on the design of smart building technologies for improving inclusion, through development of interactive systems and research prototypes. She brings to the team an expertise with sensors, data, web platforms, and user-centred design methodologies.

Within the FinTrust project, Samantha provides software engineering expertise to research within the various sub-projects, and is responsible for deployment, development and maintenance of the software prototypes which test various research hypotheses.
